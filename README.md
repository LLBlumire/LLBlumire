Welcome to my github! If you're here because you'd like to consult with me about anything, or otherwise contact me about professional services, consider contacting me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/llblumire/).

I'm a Systems Engineer with a Rust speciality. I've been working with the programming language since before it hit 1.0 (by around a month), and at this point would like to say I have a solid understanding of the ins, outs, and quirks of developing high performance, high correctness software.

I self-taught programming at the age of 11 (2008) to create mods for World of Warcraft, as I was unsatisfied with existing rotation management mods.

My interest in low level programming was sparked at the age of 13 (2010) by Minecraft Redstone, and developing complex logic circuits and eventually an ALU. This led into me picking up electronics at GCSE, and while my soldering days are behind me, my appreciation for the close-to-the-metal understanding of programming persists.

At 17 (2015) I picked up rust, having bounced between many languages at that point (Lua > C > C++ > JavaScript > Python > PHP > Java > C# > back to Python) I found that my ideal language was essentially "python with strong types". I came across Dan Callahan's "My Python's a little Rust-y" talk on April 10th at PyCon 2015 and immediately fell in love. Iterator adaptors and similar APIs on options and results provided me the expressiveness I loved in python, with even better, more elegant support for functional programming. Sum types and refutability checks provided a level of security I never even realized I wanted out of strong typing.

From then, I never looked back. I've learned other languages along the way out of academic and professional necessity (working as a full-stack web engineer & consultant), but Rust has been the language of choice for my personal and academic projects ever since.

In 2020, I picked up my first rust-based commercial role, working on the backend data processing engine of a wearable technology ski coach. The core of the infrastructure being used was already built, but there was plenty still to do: I rebuilt the geocoding algorithms, implemented an enhanced real time feedback system, translated new processing algorithms built by the data-scientists from Python into Rust, and worked on improving the application's bidirectional synchronization story.
